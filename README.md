## Hi there 👋
I'm a Software Developer and Computer Science student, currently in my final year, with strong expertise in Java, NodeJS, TypeScript, and C++. I have a passion for building secure, scalable applications and am currently developing a quantum-secure zero-knowledge proof system in Rust.

💻 Experience:
- 🏦 Worked at CME Group on a world-leading trading application—EBS Workstation—building both frontend and backend features, including trading indicators and widgets using JavaScript frameworks.
- 🌐 Extensive experience in cloud-based development, deploying applications across multiple environments and scaling a home-grown testing framework to accelerate automation.
- 🖥️ Proficient in Java, JavaScript, NodeJS, TypeScript, and C++, with additional hands-on experience in testing methodologies (regression, performance, unit testing) and CI/CD pipelines.
- 🌟 Key Skills:
Web Development: Strong foundation in modern web technologies and frameworks, delivering user-facing and backend solutions.
Cloud Computing: Familiar with Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
Testing & Automation: Skilled in using JUnit, Playwright, and Cucumber for automated testing, ensuring high standards of performance and reliability.

You can find some of my personal projects on here... but not all! Feel free to reach out for more :)
